# RemoteMethodInvocation-Whiteboard
A distributed system application for a shared whiteboard 

Shared-Whiteboard

1) Run Server.java
2) Run Client.java
3) Adding arguments can be done from Run configuration, but are optional as default host and port are provided.
4) Try to improve the design(the look of UI and Text addition or any other functionality you want to include), currently server is just for show, client works on its own. The problem is RMI. I am also working on it.
